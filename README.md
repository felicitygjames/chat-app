# chat-app

This app was built to allow users to send messages to friends, share pictures and also share your location with other users. 

It was built using React Native, Gifted Chat UI, and Google Firebase.

Use
To be able to use the app, you'll need to download or clone this repository, and have Expo Go installed on your mobile device.

The next step is to run npm install in your terminal, and that will install all the dependencies required to run the app.

Then, running expo start in the terminal will start the metro-builder/webpack-server that enables the app to run. (If you have Android Studio installed, simply run expo start --android while you also have an emulator running)

Lastly, scan the QR code generated by the metro-builder with Expo Go and the app will run on your mobile device.

Database Configuration
To be able to use a personal instance of Google Firabase, one would need an account with Google Firebase and a set of configuration data enabled when one creates a new project with Firestore.

Substitute this data with the one found in the const firebaseConfig.
